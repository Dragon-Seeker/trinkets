# Trinkets Compatibility Layer for Accessories

## Overview

This is a fork of Trinkets that uses the [Accessories API](https://github.com/wisp-forest/accessories) under the hood rather than Trinkets API allowing for a unified Accessory System. All credit goes to EMI and C4 for the design and Code of Trinkets and the given project continues the use of the MIT license.

The iteration being V2 has the added benifit to allow the end user to go back and forth if needed between using and not using the compat layer combined with preserving more code to keep binary compatbile.

All bugs and issues should be reported on the [Accessories Repo Issues](https://github.com/wisp-forest/accessories/issues) instead of here.
